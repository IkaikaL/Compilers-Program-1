Functionality: Our program returns an error when "make" is ran in the terminal, we are not sure why but the test cases run
and test1 and test 2 return what we believe to be correct.  I believe that covers every test case
but could be wrong as I did not take time to look through each one.  We built this using the sample code posted
on moodle as a template and the websites https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/current/manual.html
and https://jflex.de/manual.html as manuals for writing our code.  Using these resources we coded comments, strings, and control characters
to look at regular expressions and the first character of the input to determine the route the code will take.
